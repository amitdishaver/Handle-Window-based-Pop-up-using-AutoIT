Handle Window based Pop up using Selenium and AutoIT
I were trying to open a website with Selenium which redirects to enter a valid login in browser bases pop-up. For example - When I start webdriver and navigate to original site  the browser open a popup to enter user id and password.
I tried to pass the credentials in URL itself but didn't work. So I used AutoIt and it resolved my problem.
